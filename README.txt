# B2B Events Web Scraping Script

## Overview

This Python script scrapes data from specified B2B event websites and compiles the information into a structured CSV file. It utilizes asynchronous programming for efficient web scraping using `asyncio` and `aiohttp` libraries, and `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Libraries**: Install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4


### Running the Script

1. **Setup Script**:
- Clone or download the provided Python script (`b2b_events.py`) into a directory on your machine.

2. **Update Event URLs**:
- Open `b2b_events.py` in a text editor.
- Update the `event_urls` list with URLs of the B2B events you want to scrape.

3. **Run the Script**:
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you saved `b2b_events.py`.
- Run the script using the following command:
  ```
  python b2b_events.py
  ```

4. **Execution**:
- The script will start scraping data from the specified event URLs asynchronously.
- Data will be collected and saved to a CSV file named `b2b_events.csv` in the same directory.

### Data Collected

The script collects the following information for each event:
- Event Name
- Event Date(s)
- Location
- Website URL
- Description
- Key Speakers
- Agenda/Schedule
- Registration Details
- Pricing
- Categories
- Audience Type

### Notes

- **Error Handling**: If an event's data cannot be fully extracted due to missing elements or errors, it will be logged, and the script will continue to the next event.
- **Internet Connection**: Ensure a stable internet connection for successful web scraping.
- **CSV Output**: Check the generated `b2b_events.csv` file after running the script for the scraped data.
